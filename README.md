### 💰 Revenue Drivers
- Discounts **do not significantly increase purchase volume**.
- Revenue and quantity sold show a **strong positive correlation (0.72)**.
- Selling more items is the primary driver of revenue, not discount strategy.

👉 Business Insight: Focus on increasing sales volume rather than relying on discounts.

---

### 👑 Loyalty Tier Performance
- The **Gold loyalty tier** generates the highest business value.
- Value ranking:
  1️⃣ Gold  
  2️⃣ Silver  
  3️⃣ Bronze  

👉 Business Insight: High-value customers should be prioritized in retention strategies.

### 🚚 Delivery Performance by Region
- Delivery delays occur at **similar levels across all regions**.
- Delay rates are comparable to both:
  - Delivered on time
  - Cancelled orders
- **Price band does not affect delivery status**:
  - Low price → same delay level
  - Medium price → same delay level
  - High price → same delay level

👉 Business Insight: Delivery issues appear systemic rather than price-related.
